# LaVague Guide for Contributors ðŸŒŠ

Thanks for your interest in the project! We really appreciate all contributions, from bug reports, to suggestions to helping us build new features. Your support is vital in helping us build an awesome tool!

In this guide, we'll outline how you can contribute to the project.

If you have any further questions, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SDxn9KpqX9).

## Reporting bugs

We track bugs using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/issues/).

You can report a bug by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/issues/new/choose) using the 'bug report' template.

Please check that your bug has not already been reported before submitting a bug report and include as many details as possible to help us fix bugs faster!

## Suggesting new features

You can make a [new feature request](https://github.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/issues/new/choose) by creating a new issue and selecting the 'new feature' template.

Please provide as much information as possible: the behavior you want, why, and examples of how this feature would be used!

## Contributing to the codebase

### Identifying a feature to work on

You can see the features we're looking for help on by selecting the ['help wanted' label in our listed issues](https://github.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/labels/help%20wanted).

If one of these interests you, or you see another unassigned issue that you'd like to work on, let us know in the #contribute Discord channel or by commenting in the issue!

If you would like to work on a feature that is not listed in our GitHub issues, let us know by creating a new issue and waiting for us to validate it with the 'accepted' label.

### Setting up your local environment (full dev environment set up instructions coming soon)

First of all, you'll need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the LaVague repo.

You'll then need to clone your forked repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/LaVague.git
cd LaVague
```

### Pull requests

Once you've finished building your feature, you can submit it for review by [opening a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

When submitting a PR, please:

- Use a descriptive title
- [Link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to the issue you were working on in the PR
- Add any relevant information to the description that you could help us review your code
- [Rebase your branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase) against the latest version of `main`.
- **Coming soon** Check your branch passes all GitHub actions pass.

If you need any help or want to discuss the feature you are working on more before submitting, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SDxn9KpqX9)!
