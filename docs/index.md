## 🏄‍♀️  What is LaVague?

LaVague is an **open-source Large Action Model framework** for turning **natural language** into **browser actions**.

At LaVague's core, we have an **Action Engine** which uses **advanced AI techniques** (RAG, Few-shot learning, Chain of Thought) to “compile” natural language instructions into browser automation code, by leveraging **Selenium** or **Playwright**.

### LaVague in Action

Here's an example of LaVague being used to execute natural language instructions on a browser to automate web interactions. This example uses the Gradio interface available with the `lavague launch` CLI command:

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running LaVague in your local env

You can get started with `LaVague` in 2 steps:

1. Install LaVague & dependencies
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lavague-ai/LaVague/main/setup.sh &&
sudo bash setup.sh
```

2. Run your LaVague command!
```
lavague --instructions examples/instructions/huggingface.yaml --config examples/configurations/api/openai_api.py build
```

For a step-by-step guide or to run LaVague in a Google Colab, see our [quick-tour](https://docs.lavague.ai/en/latest/docs/get-started/quick-tour/) which will walk you through how to get set-up and launch LaVague with our CLI tool.

## 🎭 Playwright integration

If you want to get started with LaVague build using Playwright as your underlying automation tool, see our [Playwright integration guide](./docs/get-started/playwright.md)

    This project executes LLM-generated code using `exec`. This is not considered a safe practice. We therefore recommend taking extra care when using LaVague (such as running LaVague in a sandboxed environment)!
