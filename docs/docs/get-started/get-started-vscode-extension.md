# Get started: LaVague VSCode Extension

The LaVague VSCode Extension allows you to leverage LaVague directly in VSCode. 

You can generate your automation code and directly preview and test the generated code within VSCode!

## üîß Pre-requisites

To use our VSCode extension you will need:

- A version of VSCode >= 1.80

- The Jupyter notebooks VSCode extension

- You will still need to install the chrome webdriver & LaVague. You can do this by running our `setup.sh` LaVague installation script [available here](https://github.com/lavague-ai/LaVague)

See the LaVague installation instructions [for more details](https://docs.lavague.ai/en/latest/docs/get-started/setting-up-la-vague/)!

### Opening a new project

- Firstly, you'll need to download the `LaVague` extension from VSCode marketplace.

- Now, you can open your first LaVague project. You can do this by opening the VSCode Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P

- Type or search and find the 'LaVague: New project' command

This will open a new LaVague Jupyter notebook file in VSCode with some pre-filled cells of code.

### Adding your URL and instruction

You can add the URL you wish to generate automation code for in the first cell block.

If we now run this first block of code, we can see a new VSCode window opens displaying our target site.

We're now ready to add an instruction for the action we'd like to automate:

> Note you will need to have an OpenAI API key set in your notebook environment. If you don't have yours set in this environment, you can add the following code into a cell:

  ```
  import os
  os.environ['OPENAI_API_Key'] = ''
  ```

Your automation code will populate the next cell.

By running this cell, we can now see the result of our automation code in our VSCode browser window:

### Tips

Note, it is possible to include a sequence of actions in one instruction as follows:

`%lavague_exec "click on the files and versions tab, then scroll down to the bottom of the page"`

‚ö†Ô∏è Also note the extension always expects the cell following the cell with our `%lavague_exec` command to be empty so it can populate it with the generated automation code. 

If you don't have an empty cell, you will see the following error:

Therefore, to run a new command now, we can move the previous generated code above our `%lavague_exec` command:
